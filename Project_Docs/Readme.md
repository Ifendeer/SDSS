Data storage is one of the most important part of humanity. Without data storage (mental or physical storing of data) society will not advance a whole lot, or might fall abruptly.

What is a Data storage: Storing of knowledge, so that the knowledge is accessible at a later time or date.

	Data storage types:
			1 – Physical data storages.
			2 – Mental data storages.

A society is as strong as it’s data storage technologies. Without storing of data a society’s all inventions will become obsolete and forgotten.


Physical data storages – Physical data storages contains data at one or more physical place. This form of data can destroyed pretty efficiently if all of the fragments of such data is destroyed. 
But this form of data is more often very reliable because of it being individual object or fragment.
Mental data storages – A person’s memories or their knowledge. This form of data can be inaccurate and if the person dies or suffers from memory problems the data can be inaccessible. 

To make a data storage reliable we need to use a physical data storage. In 2020 people uses smartphone and computers a lot for storing their data. But if a disaster happens and all computers become unusable, we will even lose the data about how to make or use computers in the first place. Books can also be used as an alternative data storage, but we can’t contain all of the data from computers in books.

So, this is my first attempt of creating a storage technique or using an old storage technique to store enormous amount of data from the whole humanity. This project can only be completed by the help of other humans who are still alive (or dead persons can help with their history).




To begin I am calling this new data storage system “Smart Data Storage Style”, SDSS for short.
It may contain old techniques of data storage for convenience, and new techniques whenever found more efficient. 

## 8 Rules of SDSS: (Numbers may vary based on latest update)
1.	Cut down the amount of data into very small chunk, from which later civilizations can derive conclusions on their own.
2.	Make the data memorable by visual stimulation, or sound. Like an impressive Icon, or a beautiful melody (example - a song about said subject).
3.	The data needs to be reduced at a scale that can be distributed to everyone.
4.	The data needs to be appealing to older audience and young ones at the same time.
5.	Data storage must also contain controversial or taboo topics for a clear understanding of said subject (if available).
6.	Data may be fragmented id necessary so people can carry what amount of knowledge they need.
7.	Data storage needs to be free for all to access
8.	Data storage needs to be in multiple physical forms. (example – Books, Digital Drive, Sculpture, etc.)

It is an open standard, but due to organizations trying to modify or repair open standards we should make a safe place where the standards will be updated without any help of organizations.

And due to its important as being in multiple forms, we should distribute all our accumulated data in book or sculpture form at least once every 2 years.
